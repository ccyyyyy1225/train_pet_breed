ABSTRACT (≈300 words)

This project presents a deep-learning–based pet breed classification system that identifies common dog and cat breeds from images. The dataset is organized into class folders, and although each class contains only a small number of images, the system remains practical for demonstration purposes by combining transfer learning and strong data augmentation. We adopt a pre-trained convolutional neural network (ResNet18 trained on ImageNet) as a feature extractor, and fine-tune a lightweight classification head for the target breeds. During training, images are augmented with random crops, horizontal flips, mild rotations, and brightness/contrast variations to improve generalization under limited data. The model is evaluated using a held-out test split, and performance is analyzed through learning curves, a confusion matrix, and a classification report.

To extend the core model into an interactive application, we develop a Streamlit web app that allows users to upload pet photos and receive real-time breed predictions. The app reports top-k results with confidence scores and optionally visualizes model attention using Grad-CAM to provide interpretability. This end-to-end project demonstrates essential deep learning workflows, including dataset splitting, preprocessing, transfer learning, model evaluation, and cloud deployment via GitHub and Streamlit Cloud. The pipeline is modular and can be easily adapted to additional breeds or other image classification tasks. Overall, the work provides both educational value and a user-friendly demo that showcases how modern deep learning models can be applied to practical recognition problems with minimal training data.
